# Splatt2 — DIY Target Shooting Trainer

A computer-vision dry-fire and live-fire training tool for air rifle and air pistol. It uses a webcam mounted to the barrel (or stock) to track where the rifle is pointing, detects shots by audio click, and scores them on a digital target in real time.

No special hardware required — just a webcam, a microphone, a printer, and a computer.

---

## How It Works

1. Print the **ArUco marker sheet** from within the app and stick it behind your target.
2. Mount a small USB webcam to your rifle so the lens points at the target.
3. Start Splatt2 — it detects the four corner markers and establishes a live millimetre-accurate coordinate system.
4. As you aim, a crosshair tracks your hold on the digital target in real time.
5. When a shot fires (air-gun click detected by microphone), the position at the **exact moment of audio detection** is recorded — not the position when the software processes it, eliminating software lag.
6. The shot is scored and displayed instantly.

### Why ArUco markers?

ArUco markers are small square patterns (like QR codes) that OpenCV can detect and locate with sub-pixel accuracy. By placing four markers at the corners of a known-size sheet, the software computes a **homography** — a perspective transform that converts raw pixel coordinates into millimetres relative to the target centre, correcting for camera angle, tilt, and distance automatically.

### Scoring model

Scoring is purely geometric and independent of the visual ring boundaries drawn on the target:

- **R** = `card_diameter / 2 + pellet_diameter / 2` (e.g. 22.75 + 2.25 = **25.0 mm** for .177 on 10m air rifle)
- Any shot whose **centre** is within R of target centre scores; beyond R = 0 (miss)
- **Integer mode**: 10 equal bands of `R/10`. Band 0 = 10, band 9 = 1.
- **Decimal mode**: 99 equal bands of `R/99`. Band 0 = 10.9, band 98 = 1.0.

Changing the pellet calibre in Settings instantly shifts all scoring bands — one setting covers both .177 and .22 shooters using the same target.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit)
- **Python 3.9+** — download from https://python.org — tick **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
- A webcam (USB recommended for barrel-mounting; built-in works for testing)
- A microphone (built-in laptop mic is fine for dry-fire; closer to the action is better for live fire)

---

## Quick Start

1. Install Python from https://python.org (tick "Add Python to PATH")
2. Download or clone this repository
3. Double-click **`RUN.bat`**

That's it. `RUN.bat` automatically installs all Python dependencies (`numpy`, `opencv`, `sounddevice`, `Pillow`, `scipy`) the first time it runs, then launches Splatt2. On subsequent runs it checks for updates to dependencies and starts immediately.

> **To share with someone else:** give them the folder and tell them to install Python and double-click `RUN.bat`. No compilation, no installers, no antivirus drama.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Print the marker sheet

- Start Splatt2 and click **"Print Marker Sheet"** in the right panel
- Select your target type and shooting distance
- Save the PNG and print at **100% scale** on A4 — do **not** scale to fit
- Confirm the printed sheet is exactly **210 × 297 mm**

The dashed circles on the sheet show where each scoring ring falls at your chosen distance. A printed target placed in the centre should align with these guides.

### 2. Set up the target

Place or tape your printed target over the centre of the marker sheet. For ISSF 10m air rifle, the target card is small enough that all four ArUco markers remain visible around it.

> **Tip:** Laminate the marker sheet or put it in a transparent sleeve — it can be reused indefinitely.

### 3. Mount the camera

The camera should be mounted so it can see **all four markers** simultaneously. It does not need to be perfectly aligned — the homography corrects for any angle or offset. A small elastic band or cable tie around the barrel or scope body works well for a temporary mount.

Aim for the marker sheet to fill roughly **60–80% of the camera frame**. Closer = more accurate tracking; too close and markers may leave the frame.

### 4. Configure the camera

- Open **Settings → Camera**
- Set **Camera Index** (0 = first webcam, 1 = second, etc.)
- Press **Detect** to find available cameras automatically
- Recommended resolution: **640 × 480** (balances speed and accuracy)
- If the image is upside-down, enable **Flip image**
- Use the **↻** button in the bottom bar to rotate 90° if needed

### 5. Configure audio

- Open **Settings → Audio**
- Press **Start Camera** first, then fire a dry shot or make a click sound
- Watch the **MIC** level bar at the bottom — it should spike on each shot
- Adjust **THRESH** until only real shots trigger (not ambient noise)
- **SENS** controls how much louder than ambient the click must be — higher = more selective
- Set the audio device index if the wrong microphone is being used

### 6. Zero the rifle

- Press **◎ Zero** in the bottom bar
- Aim at the target centre and fire one shot (dry-fire or live)
- The software offsets all subsequent shots so that shot registers at (0, 0)

For fine adjustment after a sighting string:
- Press **⊕ Fine Zero**
- Click directly on the centre of your group on the target canvas
- The offset is applied immediately and saved across restarts

### 7. Start shooting

- Press **▶ Start Series** to begin recording
- Each shot is appended to a CSV file immediately — safe against crashes
- The series ends when the configured number of shots is reached, or click the button again to stop early
- Click **📋 Series Review** to analyse the series in detail

## The Interface

### Left panel — Camera
Live camera feed with detected markers highlighted and the aim-point crosshair overlaid. The tracking quality bar shows how many markers are visible:
- **Green (>60%)** — all or most markers detected, full accuracy
- **Yellow (30–60%)** — partial detection, homography being reused
- **Red (<30%)** — tracking lost, shots will be rejected

### Centre panel — Target
- **Traces** — the path of the aim point before each shot, colour-coded by time:
  - Dark grey = approach (moving onto target)
  - Green = hold (on target, early)
  - Yellow = pre-shot window (~1s before shot)
  - Red = final window (~0.2s before shot)
- **Shot holes** — filled circles scaled to actual pellet diameter, numbered by shot index
- **ACP diamond** — Aim Centre Point, the mean hold position over the final fraction of each trace
- **MPI cross** — Mean Point of Impact across all shots in the series
- **Group circle** — smallest circle enclosing all shots (Extreme Spread)

### Right panel — Scores
Series total at top, then per-shot statistics (Mean Radius, Extreme Spread, CEP, standard deviations). The shot log lists every shot with score, coordinates, hold time, and flags.

**Display toggles** (two rows of buttons):
- **◈ ACP** — show/hide aim centre points
- **⊡ Shots** — show/hide shot bounding box
- **◇ ACP Box** — show/hide ACP bounding box
- **● Dot** — switch shot holes to tiny dots (less clutter)
- **○ Group** — show/hide the group circle and MPI cross

### Bottom bar
Left to right: Pause, Zero, Fine Zero, decimal scoring toggle (DEC), camera rotation, microphone level, trigger threshold slider, sensitivity slider, on-target indicator.

## Target Files

Targets live in the `targets/` folder as CSV files. The app reads all `.csv` files at startup — drop a new file in and restart to add a new target.

### CSV format

```
# Comment lines start with #
key,my_target                    ← unique identifier, no spaces
name,My Custom Target            ← display name
gauging,outward                  ← outward (hole touches ring) or inward (hole inside ring)
calibre_mm,4.5                   ← default pellet diameter
reference_dist_m,10.0            ← nominal shooting distance
aiming_mark_dia_mm,30.5          ← diameter of the black bull (for marker sheet)
card_diameter_mm,45.5            ← outer edge of the scoring card

score,ring_diameter_mm           ← data section header
10,0.5                           ← 10-ring: 0.5mm diameter visual boundary
9,5.5
8,10.5
...
1,45.5
```

> **Important:** the ring diameters here are **visual only** — they control how the target looks on screen and on the printed sheet. The scoring bands are computed purely from `card_diameter_mm` and the pellet calibre set in Settings, independent of these visual rings.

### Built-in targets
| File | Target |
|------|--------|
| `10m_air_rifle.csv` | ISSF 10m Air Rifle — 45.5mm card, .177 |
| `10m_air_pistol.csv` | ISSF 10m Air Pistol — 155.5mm card, .177 |
| `6yd_air_rifle.csv` | NSRA 6 Yard Air Rifle — 31mm card, .22, inward gauging |

### Target Creator

Open **Print Marker Sheet → Target Creator** tab to create or edit targets without editing CSV files directly. A live preview shows the computed scoring geometry (R, band widths) as you type.

---

## Session Files

Sessions are saved in the `sessions/` folder (next to the app, or as configured in Settings). Each day of shooting creates a subfolder named `YYYY-MM-DD/`. Within each day, each series is a separate file named `HH-MM-SS_name_series1.csv`.

Each `.csv` has a companion `.json` file with full trace data for the Series Review window.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| P | Pause / resume |
| Space | Undo last shot |
| R | Reset all (clears shots, preserves zero) |
| S | Save shots to CSV |
| Q | Quit |

## Troubleshooting

**Tracking quality is 0% / no markers detected**
- Check that all four markers are visible in the camera frame
- Improve lighting — ArUco detection needs good contrast (avoid glare on the sheet)
- Enable CLAHE in Settings → Camera (helps with uneven indoor lighting)
- Make sure the printed sheet is flat and undamaged
- Verify the ArUco dictionary in Settings matches the one used to print the sheet

**Shots not registering / "SHOT REJECTED"**
- "No tracking" — camera can't see markers when the shot fired; reposition
- "Outside approach zone" — aim point was too far from target when shot fired (false positive rejected)
- Lower the audio threshold if real shots aren't being detected
- Check the MIC bar spikes on each shot

**"Zero mode — no markers, try again"**
- The zero shot fired while markers weren't visible; reposition and try again
- Zero mode stays active — just fire again once markers are in frame

**Score seems wrong**
- Check the pellet diameter in Settings → Target matches your actual calibre
- Verify the correct target type is selected
- Note: scoring bands are wider than the visual rings — a shot visually inside the 9-ring may score 10 depending on geometry

**Camera not opening**
- Try camera index 0, 1, 2 in Settings → Camera → Detect
- Close other applications using the webcam
- On Windows, check Camera privacy settings (Settings → Privacy → Camera)

**Dependencies fail to install**
- Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed: open Command Prompt and type `python --version`
- Try manually: `pip install opencv-python sounddevice numpy Pillow scipy`
- Check your internet connection — pip downloads from pypi.org

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. A few guidelines:

- Target definitions belong in `targets/*.csv` — no hardcoded ring values in Python
- Scoring logic lives in `core/tracker.py:score_shot()` — keep it geometry-only
- UI code is in `ui/app.py` — it's large but structured into clear method groups
- Run a syntax check before submitting: `python -m py_compile core/*.py ui/*.py`
- Test with `python main.py` before raising a pull request

## Safety

- Only fire live rounds on an authorised range, observing all range safety rules
- The software does not know whether a round is live or blank — treat every shot as live
- Do not point any firearm at a person or animal under any circumstances
